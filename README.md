# next-probabilities
Look into the properties of P(t<sub>i</sub> | Â¬t<sub>j</sub> &forall; j < i). This is the probability that an event will happen on the next timestep, given that it hasn't happened on any timesteps yet. For example, if you are modeling bus wait times with a Poisson, they come an average of every ten minutes, you ran up on the previous bus pulling away, and you've been waiting for t<sub>i</sub> minutes after that - what's the probability of the bus coming during minute t<sub>i+1</sub>? For example, is P(arrival = 11 | arrival > 10) greater than P(arrival = 10 | arrival > 9)? What minutes-so-far value maximizes the chance of the bus coming in the next minute, and how does that relate to the average time?
